# Board Game Ruler

This repo uses **uv** for dependency management and a small set of opinionated tooling:
- ruff (lint + format)
- pytest (tests)
- pre-commit (runs checks locally)
- GitHub Actions CI (runs checks on PRs)

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1) Install deps
uv sync --dev

# 2) Install git hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# 3) Run checks
make lint
make test
```

**pyproject.toml**: This is the standard config file for Python projects. Tools read their config from here.
[dependency-groups] defines groups, for example dev. which uv treats as local development.
[tool.uv] `required-version` forces a minimum uv version for contributers.
[tool.ruff] and [tool.pytest.ini_options] configure ruff/pytest so nobody needs local editor-specific config.
Add packages like `uv add package`

**.pre-commit-config.yaml**: Configuration for the `pre-commit` tool. It runs automatically when you commit and checks for formatting, linting, basic sanity. Prevents style drift.

**.github/workflows/ci.yml**: This is a GitHub Actions pipeline. It checks out the code, sets python from .python-version, installs uv and runs pre-commit and pytest.

**uv.lock**: Created automatically when running uv. It's uv's lockfile and pins exact resolved versions for reproducible installs.

**.python-versions**: A pinned Python version file used by pyenv and uv. Ensures developers and CI run the same python version.

**.gitattributes**: Git rules for line endings and text normalization. Windows vs Mac line ending issues are a classic source of noisy diffs. This file helps enforce consistency.

**docker-compose.yml**:

**.vscode/settings.json**: Workspace-specific VS Code settings (comitted). Ensures the repo opens with `.venv` interpreter path and zsh as default terminal.
